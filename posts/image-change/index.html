The error itself I forgot to write down.

(The ghcr package for this particular repo was marked as private only). I started trying to recover what was a downed service. A brief spat of web searches and I discover that when creating a custom docker image 2 things are true. The first that it&rsquo;s stored as an xml template in <code>/boot/config/plugins/dockerMan/templates-user</code>. The second that I didn&rsquo;t have to open the XML file and try to transcode as I had thought. You can simply go to <code>Docker</code> -> <code>Add Container</code> -> <code>Templates</code> and all of your custom docker invocations are contained there as templates. Easy Peasy.</p></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=https://blog.sions.org/posts/usb-wake/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
