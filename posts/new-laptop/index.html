It seems the i5 isn&rsquo;t a supported generation, though. So back to good ol&rsquo; Windows 10. Which worked great during testing! As I&rsquo;m a self-described Linux fan, I then proceeded to install and setup Linux Mint Debian Edition like I run on my old laptop and my current desktop.</p><p>Sadly, I didn&rsquo;t like it. There was nothing concretely wrong, but it didn&rsquo;t feel as fluid as it was supposed to, maybe I&rsquo;m growing out of Linux on my personal workstations. But it didn&rsquo;t feel right. Cinnamon has a primary focus on being used on a desktop. Gnome Shell felt better, but the onscreen keyboard wasn&rsquo;t reliable at detecting when to pop up. Moving from tablet to laptop mode was a hassle as there wasn&rsquo;t a software tablet mode to enable or something.</p><p>Well, back to Windows. It works fine, but I&rsquo;ll need to rethink a couple different workflows.</p></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button next"><a href=https://blog.sions.org/posts/sarpine-fourth/><span class=button__text>Sarpine, Fourth Session</span>
