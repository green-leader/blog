My first post. Well my first *actual* post was supposed to be a log/ tutorial/ step by step/ whatever of setting up Jekyll and Backblaze and cloudflare. Well that was several days ago. Now I'm typing this, a quick draft within Google Keep. Turn it into Markdown tomorrow. Post it day after. But largely I've been dragging my feet, what's the goal of this blog? Is there one? Does there need to be one?
