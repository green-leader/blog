Didn't post last week when I got it, guess I was feeling a little burnt out.

But hey, first certification. Can't necessarily use it at this point yet but I've got it and during the course of studying for it I definitely found that a number of things make more sense. Even just browsing the Homelab subreddit last night I could tell I had a better understanding than I did a couple months ago.
