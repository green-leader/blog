We finished up a game session, and I thought I would give a bit of a summary. This is more for recurring writing exercises than anything else.

We start the session with our intrepid heroes completing their daily tasks. They haven't formed an adventuring party yet, and they haven't exchanged names at this point in the story.

With the last of the continent's unified army having arrived, most members of this encampment the size of a small city are informed training will start today. Upon completing their assignments, Xen and Storm proceed to their designated training location. Which appears to largely be seating arranged around a stage, large enough for a few hundred at a time. After most of the people in attendance take their seats, the leader of training, Captain Sandaman, informs all in attendance that over the next several days they will have a chance to act in a role as a leader and gain plenty of experience acting through situations that have been recovered through the memories of soldiers.

The Captain Sandaman again directs all to sit before several mages on the stage proceed to cast a unique spell that places all present under a deep trance.

Shortly after everything went dark, Xen and Storm found themselves walking along a corridor in a cave. Tasked with securing the contents of the cave until assistance could show up, they delved deeper. The small group exchanged names and consists of Xen, Storm, Alan, and Kernick.

The party eventually finds an orange substance on the wall that appears to be Dragonspark, a physical manifestation of the ley lines. Xen, learning of its ability to combust, starts to give it a wider berth due to the motes of flame around his head for light. The party proceeds to take a brief break before starting on the goal of securing the cave. A brief exploration led to a couple of revelations. The first being that there was a spark springâ€”a physical spring caused as a result of the leyline. The second is that there appears to be a pile of corpses, skeletons, and weapons. Some amphibious merfolk creatures seem to be using this as part of their hunting grounds. The tridents and a body of underground water appear to correlate with this.

Before long, the merfolk came ashore and attacked, as did a being that seemed to be blurry, coming out of the wall near the spark spring. Quickly dispatching them with an explosive set-off near the spark spring, the party started to lick their wounds as everything faded back to what they knew as reality.
