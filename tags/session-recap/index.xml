&lt;p>We start the session with our intrepid heroes completing their daily tasks. They haven&amp;rsquo;t formed an adventuring party yet, and they haven&amp;rsquo;t exchanged names at this point in the story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the last of the continent&amp;rsquo;s unified army having arrived, most members of this encampment the size of a small city are informed training will start today. Upon completing their assignments, Xen and Storm proceed to their designated training location. Which appears to largely be seating arranged around a stage, large enough for a few hundred at a time. After most of the people in attendance take their seats, the leader of training, Captain Sandaman, informs all in attendance that over the next several days they will have a chance to act in a role as a leader and gain plenty of experience acting through situations that have been recovered through the memories of soldiers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Captain Sandaman again directs all to sit before several mages on the stage proceed to cast a unique spell that places all present under a deep trance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Shortly after everything went dark, Xen and Storm found themselves walking along a corridor in a cave. Tasked with securing the contents of the cave until assistance could show up, they delved deeper. The small group exchanged names and consists of Xen, Storm, Alan, and Kernick.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The party eventually finds an orange substance on the wall that appears to be Dragonspark, a physical manifestation of the ley lines. Xen, learning of its ability to combust, starts to give it a wider berth due to the motes of flame around his head for light. The party proceeds to take a brief break before starting on the goal of securing the cave. A brief exploration led to a couple of revelations. The first being that there was a spark springâ€”a physical spring caused as a result of the leyline. The second is that there appears to be a pile of corpses, skeletons, and weapons. Some amphibious merfolk creatures seem to be using this as part of their hunting grounds. The tridents and a body of underground water appear to correlate with this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before long, the merfolk came ashore and attacked, as did a being that seemed to be blurry, coming out of the wall near the spark spring. Quickly dispatching them with an explosive set-off near the spark spring, the party started to lick their wounds as everything faded back to what they knew as reality.&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
