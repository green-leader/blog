I acquired a secondhand Dell Latitude 5285. The specs (i5, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD) aren&amp;rsquo;t as fancy as they could be, but the price was right.
I initially tried to install Windows 11 to determine if the device was entirely functional, as one does with a used device. It seems the i5 isn&amp;rsquo;t a supported generation, though.

&lt;p>I initially tried to install Windows 11 to determine if the device was entirely functional, as one does with a used device. It seems the i5 isn&amp;rsquo;t a supported generation, though. So back to good ol&amp;rsquo; Windows 10. Which worked great during testing! As I&amp;rsquo;m a self-described Linux fan, I then proceeded to install and setup Linux Mint Debian Edition like I run on my old laptop and my current desktop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sadly, I didn&amp;rsquo;t like it. There was nothing concretely wrong, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t feel as fluid as it was supposed to, maybe I&amp;rsquo;m growing out of Linux on my personal workstations. But it didn&amp;rsquo;t feel right. Cinnamon has a primary focus on being used on a desktop. Gnome Shell felt better, but the onscreen keyboard wasn&amp;rsquo;t reliable at detecting when to pop up. Moving from tablet to laptop mode was a hassle as there wasn&amp;rsquo;t a software tablet mode to enable or something.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, back to Windows. It works fine, but I&amp;rsquo;ll need to rethink a couple different workflows.&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
